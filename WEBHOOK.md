# CopperX Payout Bot Webhook Setup

This guide explains how to set up and deploy the CopperX Payout Telegram Bot using webhooks.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.com  # Public-facing server URL
```

## Development Setup

For local development:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Use ngrok to create a public URL (in a separate terminal):
   ```
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. Update `.env` file with the ngrok URL:
   ```
   SERVER_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
   ```

4. Start the webhook server in development mode:
   ```
   npm run webhook:dev
   ```

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: Traditional Server (VPS/Dedicated)

1. Build the webhook server:
   ```
   npm run webhook:build
   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

### Option 2: Vercel Deployment

1. Make sure `vercel.json` has the webhook route configured.

2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Testing Your Webhook

Visit your webhook URL to check its status:
```
https://your-domain.com/
```

You should see a status page with the bot's current webhook configuration.

For more details, check these endpoints:
- `/webhook-info` - See current webhook status
- `/set-webhook` - Manually set webhook
- `/delete-webhook` - Delete current webhook

- üîÑ **Transfer Menu**: Send funds, view history, withdraw

## Troubleshooting
